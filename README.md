This is a set of enhancements to C-LINK, a non-hierarchichal collective caching software originally created by Sibren Isaacman and Margaret Martonosi (more info can be found here: http://mrmgroup.cs.princeton.edu/papers/isaacman-NSDR09.pdf).  Two enhancements were made to C-LINK. First, it was made to use a DTN2 router to automatically forward data from the village to the city (the DTN2 software is available under the Apache open source license at www.dtnrg.org).  Second, a priority-based leader election scheme was implemented for the system to choose a kiosk node.  In addition, several utilities were added (including a wrapper class for sockets to facilitate easy message passing and trading of mapping files between nodes in the system).

The program "dtnconnect" handles spawning and killing all of C-LINK's processes (taking care of leader election and the DTN applications).  It takes two arguments: the first is either "city" or "user" ("city" to create the process for fetching web pages from the internet and "user" to create a process on a village machine).  It next takes the name of a configuration file.  The configuration file takes local and remote DTN addresses and directories in which to look for request and response files.  Leader election also requires a file entitled "kiosklist.cfg" to exist that contains the IP addresses of each electable kiosk in order of priority.
